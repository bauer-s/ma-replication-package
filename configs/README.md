# Configs for the whisker cluster experiments

Checkout the repository *whisker-cluster-experiments*.
Put the Whisker configuration files (`*.json`) from this folder into the `configs/` folder.

As image, use the branch *automatic-repair-surrogate-model* from the whisker repository.

Prepare the rest of the whisker cluster experiment as described in the `README.md`.

> In order to execute the cluster experiments, the surrogate model backend and the embedded-kittens service (placed in `model_backend/`) have to run!
